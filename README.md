# StereoBlender


Offers the ability to configure a stereo vision setup in blender (Version 2.8) and create a synthetic dataset.


Part of my master thesis for visualizing a stereo setup and how the change of the setup change the view perspective and overall setup. 


The basic idea and also some code snippets of this repository are taken from https://github.com/LouisFoucard/DepthMap_dataset.
